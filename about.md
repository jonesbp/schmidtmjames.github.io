The Documenting Texas Music blog is a record of the latest things we are doing at the Texas Music Museum. The Texas Music Museum, founded in 1984, is dedicated to collecting oral histories, artifacts, images, videos, and recordings that document the diverse forms of music made throughout Texas. A labor of love done by volunteers for more than three decades, it contains one of the richest collections on musicians, venues, music institutions, and record labels in the state.

If you are or know anyone who has been involved in music in Texas, please get in contact with us at schmidt.m.james@gmail.com. We are always interested in conducting new oral histories and we gratefully accept donations of photographs, documents (letters, manuscripts, or otherwise), and recordings.
